## CATS-DOGS MOBILENET

Simplified implementation of MobileNet network structure for Cats and Dogs classification (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
The model uses a series of Inverted Hourglass Residual Blocks with depth-wise convolutions. The model manages to outperform simple ResNets while maintaining lower computetional complexity and achieves better inference speed. The accuracy achieved by the model is around 0.9 with 10 epochs of training.
